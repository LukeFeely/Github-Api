# Github Access - CS3012

![](demo.gif)

My github access webapp contains a search bar with which the user looks up a github username. Information is then displayed on the screen such as the profiles name, their profile picture and their github score. The user then has a choice of three buttons which are as follows:

**Graph 1** - A bar chart that compares the amount of followers the user has to the amount of people they are following.


**Graph 2** - A pie chart that shows the ratio of languages the user has used. You can hover over a section of the chart and the language will be displayed or you can cross out languages to see a more specified pie chart.

There is also the function to show the list of repos that the user has, with links to each.
